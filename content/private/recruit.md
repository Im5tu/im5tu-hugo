    "title": "Recruiting Me?" 
}

If you've received this link from me, it's because I would like to build a long term professional relationship with you for the future. I hope that this saves a lot of time and helps you understand where my skills lie and what it is I expect in the future. 

Before you contact me, I would ask the following because of my experiences in the past with recruiters in general:

1. Please only send through roles that match the items in the section "Things I Do" below;
2. I like to do my own research about the company, so expect me to ask straight away if you don't supply the company name. And no I won't disclose the information to competitors - or reveal in reverse;
3. If I apply for a job through you, I expect clear & consistent communication and feedback until I get the final result, whatever that result may be;
4. Please try to limit the number of people from your company that approach me, I want to build long term relationships;
5. Please include location & salary/day rate in the subject header (eg: *New Opportunity: London £550/Day*);

Naturally, I will respond as soon as it is convenient to do so and talk to you first if I think there is someone that I know that might be interested in the role instead so that I can put you in touch with each other.

## What Interests Me

I love to be challenged mentally whether it's designing architectures or finding a solution to a complex problem. I need to have the choice over the technology that I use and not be constrained in my ability to create & innovate. I have a strong passion for clean coding, dependency injection, unit testing and a decent CI/CD story.

- JAVA
- C++
- SAP
- Web Forms
- VB
- Episerver/Sitefinity (or just any CMS digital agency work)

## Technical Tests

By far, I prefer technical tests that run either as a discussion or a pair programming session. In my opinion, these sessions offer greater value over writing test projects as you can get to know how a person thinks and about their attitudes towards software development.
